# quineMcCluskey
This repositorie consists on a CodeBlocks project encoding the Quine McCluskey algorithm. The algorithm receives a sequence of binary numbers as input, representing a truth table output, and returns a boolean function that covers the same set of minterms.

Example: The input "10001001" means that the output function should cover the minterm set {0,4,7}.
